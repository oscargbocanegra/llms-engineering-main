    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- ✅ Docker containers running (Conda + Ollama)\n",
    "- ✅ LLM kernel selected (Python 3.11)\n",
    "- ✅ Global `.env` file configured\n",
    "- ✅ Ollama accessible at `http://localhost:11434`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Environment Setup**\n",
    "- Load environment variables from `.env`\n",
    "- Connect to Ollama API (OpenAI-compatible interface)\n",

    "**3. Prompt Engineering**\n",
    "- Create effective system and user prompts\n",
    "- Structure messages for LLM APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. LLM API Integration**\n",
    "- Make API calls to Ollama\n",
    "- Control model behavior (temperature, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Practical Application**\n",
    "- Build summarization function\n",
    "- Generate email subject lines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output:** A working prototype that summarizes any URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Start\n",
    "1. Press `Shift + Enter` to execute each cell\n",
    "2. Install dependencies (uncomment if needed)\n",
    "3. Verify `.env` configuration loads\n",
    "4. Run connection test\n",
    "5. Experiment with different websites\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Learning Approach\n",
    "Execute this notebook yourself after watching the lecture. Add print statements, experiment with variations, and share your work on GitHub to showcase your skills."
